   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PARTIZIONE DI PROGETTO of interzone surface BLOCCO1:ZONA2_PARTITION_2_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PARTIZIONE DI PROGETTO_REV of adjacent surface BLOCCO1:ZONA3_PARTITION_4_0_10001
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 8 nominally unused constructions in input.
